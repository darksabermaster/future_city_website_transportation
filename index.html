In our city, we want a clean and efficient way to get around. First, we would like to install multiple biking paths. This will help citizens go to places on the island because everything will be within walking distance. Additionally, if they want to do something else, they can get an electric bike that will give them an easy and effective way to travel. Also, there will be taxis, so if it is too far away, someone might be unable to ride, and they can hire someone to take them. There will also have to be transportation to the mainland. This would be covered mainly by a hyperloop that will run under the sea bed to the mainland. It will be capable of going 400 mph and be the primary way of transportation to the mainland. As a backup way of transportation, we will have a simple airport.
